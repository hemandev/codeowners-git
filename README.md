Managing large-scale migrations in big monorepos with multiple codeowners can be overwhelming. Massive PRs touching thousands of files make it hard for teams to review changes efficiently.

`codeowners-git` solves this by:

- Identifying files owned by specific teams using the CODEOWNERS file.
- Creating compact, team-specific branches with only their affected files.
- Streamlining the review process with smaller, targeted PRs.
