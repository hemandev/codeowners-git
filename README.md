Managing large-scale migrations in big monorepos with multiple codeowners can be overwhelming. Massive PRs touching thousands of files make it hard for teams to review changes efficiently.

`codeowners-git` solves this by:

- Identifying files owned by specific teams using the CODEOWNERS file.
- Creating compact, team-specific branches with only their affected files.
- Streamlining the review process with smaller, targeted PRs.

> **Note:** This tool works with **unstaged files**. Make sure to check if your files are unstaged before proceeding.

## Installation

### Using npx (recommended)

Run commands directly without installation:

```bash
npx codeowners-git <command>
```

### Install globally via npm

```bash
npm install -g codeowners-git
```

Then run commands directly:

```bash
codeowners-git <command>
```

## Configuration

The tool automatically detects CODEOWNERS files in:

1. `.github/CODEOWNERS`
2. `docs/CODEOWNERS`
3. `CODEOWNERS` (root directory)

## Commands

### `--version`

Display the version of codeowners-git.

Usage:

```bash
codeowners-git --version
# or
codeowners-git -V
```

### `list`

List current CODEOWNERS entries.

Usage:

```bash
codeowners-git list [options]
```

Options:

- `--owner, -o` Filter by specific owner
- `--include, -i` Include specific patterns

Example:

```bash
codeowners-git list -o @myteam
```

### `branch`

Manage branch permissions in CODEOWNERS file.

Usage:

```bash
codeowners-git branch [options]
```

Options:

- `--owner, -o` Specify owner(s) to add/remove
- `--branch, -b` Specify branch pattern
- `--message, -m` Commit message for changes
- `--no-verify, -n` Skips lint-staged and other checks before committing
- `--push, -p` Push branch to remote after commit
- `--remote, -r` Remote name to push to (default: "origin")
- `--upstream, -u` Upstream branch name (defaults to local branch name)
- `--force, -f` Force push to remote
- `--keep-branch-on-failure, -k` Keep the created branch even if operation fails

Example:

```bash
codeowners-git branch -o @myteam -b "feature/new-feature" -m "Add new feature" -p
```

### `multi-branch`

Create branches for all codeowners with changes.

Usage:

```bash
codeowners-git multi-branch [options]
```

Options:

- `--branch, -b` Base branch name (will be suffixed with codeowner name)
- `--message, -m` Base commit message (will be suffixed with codeowner name)
- `--no-verify, -n` Skips lint-staged and other checks before committing
- `--push, -p` Push branches to remote after commit
- `--remote, -r` Remote name to push to (default: "origin")
- `--upstream, -u` Upstream branch name pattern (defaults to local branch name)
- `--force, -f` Force push to remote
- `--keep-branch-on-failure, -k` Keep created branches even if operation fails
- `--default-owner, -d` Default owner to use when no codeowners are found for changed files
- `--ignore` Comma-separated patterns to exclude codeowners (e.g., 'team-a,team-b')
- `--include` Comma-separated patterns to include codeowners (e.g., 'team-_,@org/_')

> **Note:** You cannot use both `--ignore` and `--include` options at the same time.

Example:

```bash
# Create branches for all codeowners
codeowners-git multi-branch -b "feature/new-feature" -m "Add new feature" -p

# Exclude specific teams
codeowners-git multi-branch -b "feature/new-feature" -m "Add new feature" --ignore "@ce-orca,@ce-ece"

# Include only specific patterns
codeowners-git multi-branch -b "feature/new-feature" -m "Add new feature" --include "@team-*"

# Use default owner when no codeowners found
codeowners-git multi-branch -b "feature/new-feature" -m "Add new feature" -d "@default-team"
```

This will:

1. Find all codeowners for the staged files in your repository
2. Apply any ignore/include filters if specified
3. For each codeowner (e.g., @team-a, @team-b):
   - Create a branch like `feature/new-feature/team-a`
   - Commit only the files owned by that team
   - Add a commit message like "Add new feature - @team-a"
   - Push each branch to the remote if the `-p` flag is provided
